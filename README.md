## Disclaimer
On this site, we will showcase our work for our master's thesis. The thesis is being written in collaboration with Andel Energi and, therefore, will not be made public. As a result, this site will replicate our work with data that is publicly available.

## About the Thesis
The main goal of the thesis is to research the possibilities of forecasting energy consumption. In the thesis, we will be forecasting the consumption of Andel Energi's customers. However, on this site, it will be for all consumers in Denmark. To make the forecasts, we will use both traditional statistical regression models and machine learning methods. These methods will be showcased on this site.
